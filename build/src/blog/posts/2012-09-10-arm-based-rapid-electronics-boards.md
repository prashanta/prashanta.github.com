Recently spotted two 32-bit ARM based rapid electronic prototyping boards on Kickstarter. Yes, they can live right on your breadboard! Meet Teensy 3.0 and Galago.

Teensy is designed to be compatible with Arduino. It comes with a bootloader hosted on a separate chip (all Flash memory for user program); an add-on for Arduino IDE called Teensyduino with support for common Arduino functions and popular Arduino libraries ported to Teensy.

Galago comes with its own libraries, browser based IDE (yes, its the rise of browser based coding!), integrated hardware debugger and "App Boards", much like Arduino Shields.   

|Teensy 3.0|     |Galago |
|---------:|:---:|:------|
|32 bit ARM Cortex-M4 48 MHz|**CPU**|32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 72 MHz |
|128KB Flash Memory, 16KB RAM, 2KB EEPROM |**Memory**| 32KB Flash Memory, 8KB RAM|
|18.0 x 35.0 mm | **Footprint** | 19.2 x 37.0 mm|
|~ $30	| **Price**	|$29 |

Projects like these give hobbiest/makers opportunity to migrate from 8-bit to 32-bit processors, with user friendly development environment, at an affordable price. Moreover, these projects are made with open source software and hardware, opening up possibilites to modify them and letting others contribute to the evolution of electronics development. I am quite eager to see how things are going to unfold and the sort of reaction they get from hackers/makers/tinkers.
