Hi there!

This is where I will be writing about electronics, gadgets, taking things apart (and forgetting how to put them back together), burning fingers, blowing up LEDs and other science-y things, I hope. I post stuffs here before I forget them, essentially, notes to self.

All righty, thats all for now. 

Oh yeah, you can follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/iprashanta).

_Update-18-Jan-2K13:_

I have been yearning for a blog without WYSIWYG editor. I fell in love with the idea of [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Now that I have stumbled upon [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), I feel at home. [Posterous](http://www.posterous.com) has been very friendly for past years, I have multiple blogs hosted on it. However, for a tech related blog, I needed a platform that is hugely flexibility. I will be relying on Jekyll to parse my blog site. I am going to have it hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), which will actually handle the parsing/generation part automatically. Just what a coder needs: publish posts via commits!
