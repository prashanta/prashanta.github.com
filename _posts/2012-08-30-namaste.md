Hi there!

This is where I will be writing about electronics, gadgets, taking things apart (and forgetting how to put them back together), burning fingers, blowing up LEDs and other stuffs. I post stuffs here before I forget them, essentially, notes to self.

All righty, thats all for now. 

Oh yeah, I am also on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/iprashanta), [Github](http://github.com/prashanta).

_Update 18-Jan-2013:_

I have been yearning for a blog without WYSIWYG editor for a long time. I had fell in love with the idea of [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Now that I have stumbled upon [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), I feel at home. I will be relying on Jekyll to parse my blog site. I am going to have it hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), which will actually handle the parsing/generation part automatically. Just what a coder needs: publishing posts via commits!
