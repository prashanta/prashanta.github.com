Hi there!

This is where I will be writing about electronics, gadgets, taking things apart (and forgetting how to put them back together), burning fingers, blowing up LEDs and other science-y things, I hope. I post stuffs here before I forget them, essentially, notes to self.

All righty, thats all for now.

_Update-18-Jan-2K13:_

I have been yearning for a blog without WYSIWYG editor. I fell in love with the idea of [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Now that I have stumbled upon [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), I feel at home. Posterous has been very friendly for past years, I have multiple blogs on it. However, for a tech related blog, I needed more flexibility and less fancy. I will be generating all my posts for _code/sigal_ with Jekyll and hosting them on [GitHub](http://github.com). Just what a coder needs: publish posts via commits!
