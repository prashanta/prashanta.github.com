title: About wCK Servo
---
I had a chance to work with wCK Servo from [RoboBuilder][1], a Korean company. These wCK servos are ment for building robotic platforms. wCKSs pack quite a punch:

- PID controller
- I/O pins
- Serial interface
- Daisy chain multiple units
- Highly modular
- Wide range of torque rating
