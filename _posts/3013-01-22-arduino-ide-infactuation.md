title: About Arduino and Arduino IDE
---

I love the Arduino board, helps me in rapid prototyping, swiftly test out sensors/actuators/serial devices; pretty good for hacks. However, as projects grow larger, using the Arduino IDE becomes a hassel. In my opinion Arduino is good for hobbiests and tinkers. If you are an engineering student and are thinking of using Arduino to learn about microcontrollers or using in your project, then it might not be the best way. Arduino will rob you of your adventure of learning how microcontrollers work. As a student you would want to get the basics and get down in the trenches with assembly and C/C++. Once you are through that then you can handle pretty much any microcontroller thrown at you.

I have been using a Arduino for various projects.
