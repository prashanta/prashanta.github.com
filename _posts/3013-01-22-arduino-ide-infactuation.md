title: Arduino IDE - It was just an infatuation
---

I love the Arduino board, helps me get my prototypes done faseter. But the relation I had with Arduino IDE was just an infatuation. Why? because:

1. Its suitable for small programs
2. When you start having multiple class files, you need to take special attention.
