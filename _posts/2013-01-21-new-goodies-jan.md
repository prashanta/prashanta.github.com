1.	[Ethernet Shield](arduino.in.th/product/5/ethernet-wiznet-5100micro-sd-card-shield)

	Not the official shield from Arduino, but [this](http://www.arduino.in.th/product/5/ethernet-wiznet-5100micro-sd-card-shield) functions exactly in the same way. It lacks PoE, well I don't miss it that much for now. Board quality is pretty nice too.

2. [USB-to-USART converter](http://www.arduino.in.th/product/54/usb-to-uart-cp2102)

	This one is based on CP2102 chip from [SILICON LABS](http://www.silabs.com/). This is going to need a driver installed. Download it [here](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx).

3.	[DTH-211 Temperature sensor](http://www.arduino.in.th/product/100/dht22-am2302-high-accuracy-digital-temperature-and-humidity-sensor)

	This sensor measures both temperature and humidity. Its pretty accurate for its price, _humidity: +-2%_ and _temperature: +-0.2 Celsius_.

4.	[Breadboard power supply module](http://www.arduino.in.th/product/31/breadboard-power-supply-module)

	This is very handy!
