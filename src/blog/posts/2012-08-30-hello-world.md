This blog is basically notes to myself, about things I have learned. I will be writing about electronics, gadgets, taking things apart (and forgetting how to put them back together), burning fingers, blowing up LEDs and other stuff.

I am also on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/iprashanta), [Github](http://github.com/prashanta).

_Update 18-Jan-2013:_

Found out about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), its just what I was looking for. So now I can post blogs with git commit, fantastic!
