I have come to terms with the concept "Nothing is permanent except change". Its been a while I have been working with node.js and I have found myself starting more node.js projects than Java projects. Jekyll is a good tool, yes I am moving on to site generation using node.js. Just having used [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) for couple of hours, I loved it already. In love with it so much that I decided move away from Jekyll. Also, ruby is not my cup of coffee so I could not be more happy.
