title: Using MQTT for Home Automation
---

Home automation usually involves getting data from sensors (room temperature, motion sensor) and sending some kind of data to actuators (door, blinds, heater, power socket). The data packet is usually small. MQTT is a perfect fit to exchange this type of data. For windows I am using Mosquitto broker.
