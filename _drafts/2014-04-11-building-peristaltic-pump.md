<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristaltic_pump" target="_blank">Peristaltic pump</a> utilizes the action known as *peristalsis* -contraction and relaxation of flexible tube to transport fluid. Unlike other pumps, fluid that is being pumped does not come in contact with any other part of the pump except the tube through which it is  being transported. This presents a unique use case.
