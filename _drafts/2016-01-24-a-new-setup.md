So I have decided to forge ahead my blogging effort. While switching to Windows box I had anticipated few hickups. One of them was setting up  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (my blog platform). Jekyll on Windows was such an hassel when I tried it last time, so I explored other alternatives - VMs in the cloud.

So far [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/) seem to be a nice fit. I had considered [Koding](http://www.koding.com/) also and it was pretty good, I liked it. However it was more team oriented. The free version of Koding required me to restart my VM every 20 days or so to keep my VM intact. The "container" as Codeanywhere calls it would shutdown after I logout and startup at next login. This was a fit with my workflow, since I dont need the VM to be always on.

Here are the steps to get started with Jekyll in Codeanywhere:

1. Register with Codeanywhwere. 

2.
