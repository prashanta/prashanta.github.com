Rugged Circuits make [Ruggeduino](http://ruggedcircuits.com/html/ruggeduino.html), Arduino on steroids - with overvoltage protection, overcurrent protection, ESD protection. Great stuff for people like me, "oops! I made a boo-boo". Hat tip to Rugged Circuits for showing us 10 ways to destroy an Arduino AND methods to prevent them. [Read all about it](http://ruggedcircuits.com/html/ancp01.html).
